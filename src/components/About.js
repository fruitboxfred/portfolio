            <p>
                Hi my name is Allan Bradicich and I live in Australia.
                
                I started my crypto journey around 18 months ago. I am a qualified chef by trade and at the age of 50 I wanted a career change. I was facinated with blockchain and the deeper I dove the more I consumed my time in learning about web3 and the unlimitless potentials it presents.
                Living in Australia I found that no university or training organization here, offered any courses in blockchain development so I embarked on a self taught journey, and considering I had no prior experience in coding what so ever
                I threw myself in the deep end and have been learning and developing ever since. Thank you for viewing my portfolio and I look forward to working with you soon.
